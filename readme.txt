hi this parser can calculate something like num*(num+num)+num 
example:
3*(2+2)+3
Result = 15

You can call it from CMD with exe file he named RecursiveParser.exe
example:
 ...\path\...\RecursiveParser.exe 3*(2+2)+3

or

From VS with help RecursiveParser.sln in property you need set setting enter console
in console need set expression like 3*(2+2)+3
